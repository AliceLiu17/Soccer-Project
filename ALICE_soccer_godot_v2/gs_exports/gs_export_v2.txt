Export Version: v2

PROGRESS: Testing exportation on Godot 
- Changed startup scene

RESULTS:
- Exportation successful
- Startup scene was correct
- Only starts game when clicking on `Player 1` then `Start Game`
- Doesn't work with clicking on `Player 2` then `Start Game`
- Doesn't work with clicking on `Player 1` then `Player 2` then `Start Game`
- Need to figure out terminal, IP Address, IP Port to perhaps fix the issue of 2 players and Start Game
